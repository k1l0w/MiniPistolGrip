# MiniPistolGrip
Re-imagining of the awesome Hoyt Esk8 remote to have a pistol grip.  You have to remove the POT for the board and create a separate PCB to make the remote mounted trigger assembly. That is the only way I could figure out how to package this they way that I wanted.  See Freesk8 post for more pictures: 

STLs have two versions of securing the lid to the grip body.  One with imperial machine screws size 2-56, length 7/16”, qty 6 and 4 low profile nuts that are embedded into the print (with a pause around 5.7mm height).  The other with 6 10mm m2.5 self tapping screws. 

Four screws to attach the lid and two screws to secure the trigger assembly.  Tigger assembly STL is attached for additional modeling.  

Wide grip fits both 21700 and stock hoyt battery.  Use so foam or neoprene so they don't rattle around.

Things to do:

-It needs a trigger design, which I have not gotten to yet. Works ok with a “nub”

-It also needs a bit of work for the interface between the two shells. I printed both with the interior side down which results in a great finish at the expense of those bottom/contact edges. I have only been printing for about a month so maybe someone would know a better way to print it.

-Battery might need a little foam to keep it from moving.
