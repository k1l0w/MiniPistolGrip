# MiniPistolGrip

*Description:* Re-imagining of the awesome Hoyt Esk8 remote to have a pistol grip.  You have to remove the POT for the board and create a separate PCB to make the remote mounted trigger assembly. That is the only way I could figure out how to package this they way that I wanted.  See Freesk8 post for more pictures. Right now there is a wide grip version that fits both 21700 and stock hoyt battery I can add the narrow grip that only fits the stock version later.

*Trigger Assembly:*  You can create this by using copper clad PCB material and drilling the hole pattern shown in the pdf. Or you can fabricate the PCB yourself.  The assembly uses the Hoyt trigger parts that come with the remote:  Spring, thumb wheel (maybe create your own with a trigger), key nob(?) and bracket that limits the range of motion and holds it all together. You have to de-solder the POT from the Hoyt board and mount it to the PCB.  Solder wires between the trigger PCB and the hoyt board.  The 3D models were sourced from the FreeSk8 model repository. The tigger assembly STL is attached for additional modeling you might want to do.  Maybe design your own with a remote mounted trigger?  

*File in repository* STLs have two versions of securing the lid to the grip body.  One with imperial machine screws size 2-56, length 7/16”, qty 6 and 4 low profile nuts that are embedded into the print (with a pause around 5.7mm height).  The other with 6 10mm m2.5 self tapping screws.

*Assembly:* 
1)Slide the trigger assembly into the grip body. You might need to file the sides of the trigger slot so the trigger moves clean and freely.
2)Put the two side screws in to hold down the trigger assembly. 
3) Slide battery in, Use so foam or neoprene so they don't rattle around. 
4) fold the wire down
5) Four screws to attach the lid and two screws to secure the trigger assembly.  



 

Things to do:

-It needs a trigger design, which I have not gotten to yet. Works ok with a “nub”

-It also needs a bit of work for the interface between the two shells. I printed both with the interior side down which results in a great finish at the expense of those bottom/contact edges. I have only been printing for about a month so maybe someone would know a better way to print it.

-Battery might need a little foam to keep it from moving.
